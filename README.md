  ## Description
  A responsive website currently deployed on Heroku to act as a portfolio for my coding projects. This application utilizes the npm packages express, express handlebars, mysql2, 
  and sequelize. All pages are served through handlebars. The portfolio section connects to a JawsDB database where I have stored information about any repositories I am 
  displaying in my portfolio and dynamically loads them to the page.
