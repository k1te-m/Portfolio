            My name is Kevin Miller. I am 28 years old and live in Chicago. I
            graduated with a bachelor's degree in Economics from DePaul
            University in 2014. Prior to this course I had been working in
            finance for Northern Trust Corporation for close to six years.
            There, I managed a small team tasked with valuing 401ks and pensions
            on a daily basis.

            In the last year or so I was at Northern Trust, we began working
            with some developers to automate and track a lot of our daily tasks.
            I found it to be much more interesting that what I was working on
            and and began to look into how to make a career change. I have
            always been interested in computers and technology and began
            learning some coding on my own and with friends. I am more than
            excited for this course and to continue learning! In my free time, I
            enjoy playing video games (CS:GO and other FPS games mostly),
            reading, watching sports, TV or movies, and spending time with my
            cat and fiancee.
